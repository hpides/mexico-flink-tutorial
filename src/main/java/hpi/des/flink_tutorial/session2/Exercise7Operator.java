/*
Exercise 7) In this session we also want to take advantage of Flink’s parallelism. In order to do that, Flink partitions
the data and distributes them among its Task Managers. Flink will try to do that by itself, depending on the operator,
but the user can also define how to partition the data. Write an operator that will partition the data based
on the value of the "PULocationID".

Tip 7) The method keyBy is capable of partitioning a stream based on a key
(https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/dev/stream/operators/#keyby and
https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/concepts/stateful-stream-processing.html#keyed-state). In
Flink you use the “KeySelector” operator to partition a data stream.
